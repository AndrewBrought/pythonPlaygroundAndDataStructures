Breadth-First Search (BFS) is based on the Queue Data Structure

It's a bit like having the center of a circle as the starting point and then moving out to different
radii or distances from that central point as the algorithm progresses

BFS will always give the shortest path if no edge weights are used - Note this application doesn't have
any variance of edge weight. All edges have the same weight of 1.

So, if no edge-weights are used it will always give the shortest path - because it first finds all the
vertices that are one edge away from the starting point, then, all the vertices that are 2 edges away and so on.

When you find the specified vertex (goal vertex) you know the path you've traced so far is the shortest path
to the node. If there were a shorter path then BFS would have already found it

* Applications of Breadth-First Search:
* GPS systems
* Flight reservation systems
* Finding neighbor nodes in peer-to-peer networks
* Social networking sites to find connections between users
* Web crawlers
* Many applications in artificial intelligence
* Electronics and communication engineering
* Scientific modeling

-Sometimes the behavior of BFS is described as Flood fill as it behaves much like water spreading out over
a surfaces (in an unweighted graph)
