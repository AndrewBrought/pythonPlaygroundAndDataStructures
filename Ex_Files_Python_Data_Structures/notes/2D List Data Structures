2D List applications

Representing grids like screen pixels
representing tabular data like a spreadsheet
Matrices for mathematical applications
Representing game boards
Storing and accessing data from scientific experiments
2D indices can be used to access DOM elements

A 2D list can be thought of as a list of lists
Elements can be a mixed type, but that's not common

Many of the algorithms associated with path finding work with graphs - by graphs, the sort associated with
graph theory and mathematics, not like graphs and charts.

A maze stored in a 2D list can represent a special type of graph where each cell in a list is connected by nodes
(think of each cell as a node) and adjacent cells (nodes) are connected by edges (the edges are how the nodes are connected,
not the cell edges)

Directed graph is one where the direction between the nodes matters

Undirected graph the direction doesn't matter

Weighted graphs are where each edge can have a different weight

For the purposes of this work-through we are using Undirected graphs which aren't weighted

We can have edges connected and Obstacle (where there's an obstacle in the middle of nodes)

Cartesian Coordinates are where the horizontal is represented by x and the vertical is represented by y.
We increase to the right for the x and we increase upwards for the y

Matrix Coordinates (Grid Coordinates)
vertical coordinate, row coordinate, occurs first and increases down by row number (depicted as i)

horizontal coordinate, column coordinate, occurs second and increases like the x to the right
by column number (depicted as j)

This is how you might type a 2D list, or think of them in terms of rows:
[['', '', ''],
['*', '', '*'],
['', '', '']]

Internally, it doesn't process like this so it's read horizontally:
[['', '', ''], ['*', '', '*'], ['', '', '']]

This is the output that would return if you went through the rows and printed one line at a time:
[' ', ' ', '']
['*', '', '*']
[' ', ' ', '']

This is a tiny maze represented in a text file. The numbers are the line numbers, the dots represent spaces, and the asterisks represent obstacles:
1  .   .   .
2  *   .   *
3  .   .   .
