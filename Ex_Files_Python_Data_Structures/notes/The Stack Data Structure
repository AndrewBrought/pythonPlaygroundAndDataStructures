Stack: A data structure in which all insertions and deletions are made at one end, called the top of the stack.
LIFO data structure (Last In First Out - the last element to be added is the first to be removed)

Common Stack operations:
Push(item) : push item to the top of the stack
Pop(item) : removing an item from the top of the stack
Peek(item) : return the top item without removing it - When we want to see what's on the top of the stack but we don't want to remove it
Is_empty(item) : return true if the stack is empty

Even the we call it the top of the stack - depending on the implementation it may turn out to be the left hand side or the right hand side

Applications of the Stack (higher overview, small selection of things the stack offers - all told, the stack data structure provides many powerful applications):

Reverse Polish notation for evaluating arithmetic expressions
Syntax parsing
Cold stack: space for parameters and local variables is created

Used in recursion

Undo and redo operations in word processors

Low-level assembly programing
